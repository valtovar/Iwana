Iwana
=====



Iwana is a MVC Framework for games/apps for Unity3D Game Engine.

To think that MVC is only for the user interface is the wrong idea, you can use MVC for any game, in the demo you can see the MVC-pattern working with UI (HUD.cs), player system lives and change of enemies state . With IwanaMVC everything can be a view and work properly and in an organized manner maintaining loose coupling throughout the project.
